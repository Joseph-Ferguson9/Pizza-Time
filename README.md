# Pizza-Time
Planned to give this wireframe made by coding dojo a shot and see if I can put some creative spins on it or add more functionality
than asked for. Hoping to come out with something functional and practical but also has the ability to be funny for the clients use if they care for that sort of personal input on their Pizza sites. 
# Need-to-have
1. All of the functionality that is displayed in the wireframe
2. A good looking page with pictures plus desctriptions
3. Fit the API's in well

# Nice-to-have
1. Cool background that can be set by the customer for their account
2. Tier list for customers, higher ones recieve special offers and such
3. Toby McGuire stamp of approval
